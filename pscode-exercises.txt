// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Read num1, num2
Set sum to num1+num2
Write sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If num / by 2
	Print “even”

else
	Print “odd”

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Read num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Set average to (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)/5
Set smallest to min(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
Set largest to max(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
Write average “this is the average of all the numbers”
Write smallest “this is the smallest number”
Write largest “this is the largest number”
